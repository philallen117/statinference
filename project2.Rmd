#Overview

We analysed the ToothGrowth data set distributed with R, which reports experiments on the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs.

We found ...

#Data

C. I. Bliss (1952) The Statistics of Bioassay. Academic Press.
Can be found using

```{r, cache=TRUE}
library("datasets")
```

So let's have a look

```{r}
str(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)
```


```{r,cache=TRUE}
OJgroup <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ",]
VCgroup <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC",]
```

The following may be missing the point; should go with dosages first?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(OJgroup)
summary(VCgroup)
```
